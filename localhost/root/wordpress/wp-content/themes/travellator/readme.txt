===========
ABOUT THEME
Travellator is a image focussed blogging theme designed with travel blogs in mind, but would also be suitable
for any topic where images are a big focus. It is fully responsive and features a full screen home page slider
and makes use of large format featured images on page and post templates too. The customizer makes it easy
to control the sites logo, favicon, social links and color scheme with no coding required.

===========
HOW TO USE THE THEME
Using the Travellator theme is very easy. Make sure your home page is set to display your latest posts.
Then in the Customizer check the Home Page Features to control if the slider appears, and whether you want
to display the optional pages below the slider (as in the theme demo at http://travellator.net/).
Lastly, be sure to set a beautiful featured image for all your posts so that they look great.
